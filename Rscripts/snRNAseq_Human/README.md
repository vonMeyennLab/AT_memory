## Folders

- [0_Preprocessing](https://github.com/vonMeyennLab/AT_memory/tree/main/Rscripts/snRNAseq_Human/0_PreProcessing): QC, annotation of cell types
- [1_SampleIntegration](https://github.com/vonMeyennLab/AT_memory/tree/main/Rscripts/snRNAseq_Human/1_SampleIntegration): Integration of omAT or scAT samples from one cohort or of adipocytes from one tissue.
- [2_DifferentialAnalysis](https://github.com/vonMeyennLab/AT_memory/tree/main/Rscripts/snRNAseq_Human/2_DifferentialAnalysis): UMAP, barplots, dotplots, differentialAnalysis per cell type (or per donor), transcriptional retention analysis, code for heatmaps


## Workflow
This code can be used to generate results and plots related to Fig. 1 and associated Extended Data. First, snRNAseq data are QCed, annotated, integrated and then used for differential gene expression analysis.
