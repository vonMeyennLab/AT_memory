# :file_folder: snRNAseq_Human

## Folders

- [0_Preprocessing](put link): QC, annotation of cell types
- [1_SampleIntegration](link): Integration of omAT or scAT samples from one cohort or of adipocytes from one tissue.
- [2_DifferentialAnalysis](link): UMAP, barplots, dotplots, differentialAnalysis per cell type (or per donor), transcriptional retention analysis, code for heatmaps



## Workflow
This code can be used to generate results and plots related to Fig. 1 and associated Extended Data. First, snRNAseq data are QCed, annotated, integrated and then used for differential gene expression analysis.
