## Files

- [DifferentialAnalysis](put link): DE analysis of TRAPseq
- [snRNAseq-TRAPseq](link): Integration of omAT or scAT samples from one cohort or of adipocytes from one tissue.



## Workflow
This code can be used to generate results and plots related to Fig. 3, Fig.6 and associated Extended Data. First, snRNAseq data are QCed, annotated, integrated and then used for differential gene expression analysis.
