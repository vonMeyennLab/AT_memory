## Folders

- [scripts](put link): Scripts to run ChromHMM
- [tracks](link): Enhancer tracks for adipocytes for all adipocytes, only for adipocytes from C,H,CC_s, HC or CC_l,HH,CCC,HHC mice



## Workflow
ChromHMM was used to identify enhancers for adipocytes. We selected a state that was enriched for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac but not H3K4me3 and was mapped to cCREs.
